"""Day 4 of Advent of Code 2024.

The goal of part 1 is to find the number of times the word 'XMAS' appears in
the word search in a row, column, or diagonal forwards or backwards.
We can iterate over the rows, columns, and diagonals to find the words.

The goal of part 2 is to find the number of times the word 'MAS'
appears as a diagonal X in the word search.

  Valid Diagonals:
        [M . M]    [M . S]    [S . S]    [S . M]
        [. A .] or [. A .] or [. A .] or [. A .]
        [S . S]    [M . S]    [M . M]    [S . M]

We can iterate over square portions of the word search to find the indicated
valid diagonals.
